    <h1>Algorithm Explanations for Agriculture and Power Supply</h1>

    <!-- Section 1 -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>1. Brute Force String Search</h2>
        <p><strong>Agriculture:</strong> Imagine you have a big document full of reports on crop health. You want to quickly find mentions of diseases like "blight." A brute force string search would scan through the whole document, looking for the word "blight" and letting you know where it appears.</p>
        <p><strong>Power Supply:</strong> If you're looking through a log of power outages or faults in the city's electricity system and you want to find specific terms like "outage," "maintenance," or "failures," you could use brute force search to go through the log and highlight those words.</p>

    <!-- Section 2 -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. Depth First Search (DFS)</h2>
        <p><strong>Agriculture:</strong> Imagine a network of pipes that delivers water to crops across the city. DFS can help you trace the water flow from one source to all the crops connected to it. It’s like following a path from one point and exploring everything connected to it.</p>
        <p><strong>Power Supply:</strong> In the power grid, DFS can help you explore and trace electricity routes. If there’s a fault in the grid, DFS helps identify all the areas affected by following the power lines from one substation to the next.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>3. Breadth First Search (BFS)</h2>
        <p><strong>Agriculture:</strong> Suppose you’re trying to track how a crop disease spreads from one farm to another. BFS helps you explore how the disease moves to nearby farms, step by step, and gives you a clearer picture of how big the problem could become.</p>
        <p><strong>Power Supply:</strong> BFS is helpful when restoring power after an outage. It can find the quickest way to send power from a working substation to all the affected areas, starting with the closest ones.</p>

    <!-- Section 4 -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>4. Bubble Sort</h2>
        <p><strong>Agriculture:</strong> Let’s say you have a list of crops sorted by their harvest time. Bubble sort helps you easily rearrange them so that the earliest harvested crops are listed first. It’s simple but not always the fastest method for big lists.</p>
        <p><strong>Power Supply:</strong> You might want to organize power usage records by the time of day or the area. Bubble sort will sort these records, so you can quickly find which areas consumed the most electricity during certain times.</p>

    <!-- Section 5 -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>5. Insertion Sort</h2>
        <p><strong>Agriculture:</strong> Insertion sort can help organize crop reports by severity. For example, when new reports come in, the algorithm inserts them into a list that’s already sorted, keeping everything in order.</p>
        <p><strong>Power Supply:</strong> Insertion sort can be useful to organize data about power consumption. As new data comes in, it inserts it in the correct order, allowing you to track electricity usage over time.</p>
