                    <strong>What kinds of problems can we observe in nature? (iteration, recursion, backtracking)</strong>
                    <p class="ans">Nature is full of complex systems that can be modeled using computational concepts such as iteration, recursion, and backtracking. Examples include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Seasons change cyclically, which can be modeled using iteration.</li>
                            <li>Leaf growth patterns, which often follow recursive patterns, can be described through recursive algorithms.</li>
                            <li>Ants navigating their territory can be modeled using backtracking to explore all possible paths and return to the starting point.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <strong>What is space and time efficiency, and why are they important?</strong>
                    <p class="ans">Space and time efficiency refer to the amount of memory and time an algorithm requires to execute. These concepts are crucial because:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Time efficiency determines how quickly an algorithm can solve a problem.</li>
                            <li>Space efficiency determines how much memory is needed for an algorithm to run, which is vital in resource-constrained environments.</li>
                        </ul>
                        The orders of growth for algorithms (e.g., O(n), O(log n)) provide insight into how an algorithmâ€™s performance scales with increasing input size. Understanding this helps in choosing the right algorithm for a given task.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>What have you learned from the design principles in Chapter 2?</strong>

                            <li>Binary Search Trees (BST) improve search operations by ensuring elements are ordered.</li>
                            <li>AVL and Red-Black Trees maintain balance, preventing skewed data that could slow down operations.</li>
                            <li>Heaps and Tries are specialized for tasks like priority queues and efficient string matching.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>Tree traversals (pre-order, in-order, post-order) focus on a hierarchical structure, where each node has a single parent and no cycles.</li>
                            <li>Graph traversals (DFS, BFS) explore networks of interconnected nodes, allowing for cycles and multiple paths between nodes.</li>
                        </ul>
                        Both traversal methods have applications in pathfinding, data structure organization, and solving problems like the shortest path or connectivity.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>How do sorting and searching algorithms connect to the real world?</strong>

                    <strong>Why are graph algorithms important in spanning trees and shortest path problems?</strong>
                    <p class="ans">Graph algorithms like spanning trees and shortest path algorithms are essential for network design and optimization. Examples include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Spanning Tree Algorithms (like Kruskalâ€™s and Primâ€™s) are crucial in network design for connecting nodes at minimal cost (e.g., fiber optics, power lines).</li>
                            <li>Shortest Path Algorithms (like Dijkstraâ€™s and Bellman-Ford) are used in GPS systems and routing protocols to find the most efficient paths between locations.</li>
