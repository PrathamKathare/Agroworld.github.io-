                    <strong>What kinds of problems can we observe in nature? (iteration, recursion, backtracking)</strong>
                    <p class="ans">Nature is full of complex systems that can be modeled using computational concepts such as iteration, recursion, and backtracking. Examples include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Seasons change cyclically, which can be modeled using iteration.</li>
                            <li>Leaf growth patterns, which often follow recursive patterns, can be described through recursive algorithms.</li>
                            <li>Ants navigating their territory can be modeled using backtracking to explore all possible paths and return to the starting point.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <strong>What is space and time efficiency, and why are they important?</strong>
                    <p class="ans">Space and time efficiency refer to the amount of memory and time an algorithm requires to execute. These concepts are crucial because:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Time efficiency determines how quickly an algorithm can solve a problem.</li>
                            <li>Space efficiency determines how much memory is needed for an algorithm to run, which is vital in resource-constrained environments.</li>
                        </ul>
                        The orders of growth for algorithms (e.g., O(n), O(log n)) provide insight into how an algorithm’s performance scales with increasing input size. Understanding this helps in choosing the right algorithm for a given task.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>What have you learned from the design principles in Chapter 2?</strong>

                            <li>Binary Search Trees (BST) improve search operations by ensuring elements are ordered.</li>
                            <li>AVL and Red-Black Trees maintain balance, preventing skewed data that could slow down operations.</li>
                            <li>Heaps and Tries are specialized for tasks like priority queues and efficient string matching.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>Tree traversals (pre-order, in-order, post-order) focus on a hierarchical structure, where each node has a single parent and no cycles.</li>
                            <li>Graph traversals (DFS, BFS) explore networks of interconnected nodes, allowing for cycles and multiple paths between nodes.</li>
                        </ul>
                        Both traversal methods have applications in pathfinding, data structure organization, and solving problems like the shortest path or connectivity.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>How do sorting and searching algorithms connect to the real world?</strong>

                    <strong>Why are graph algorithms important in spanning trees and shortest path problems?</strong>
                    <p class="ans">Graph algorithms like spanning trees and shortest path algorithms are essential for network design and optimization. Examples include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Spanning Tree Algorithms (like Kruskal’s and Prim’s) are crucial in network design for connecting nodes at minimal cost (e.g., fiber optics, power lines).</li>
                            <li>Shortest Path Algorithms (like Dijkstra’s and Bellman-Ford) are used in GPS systems and routing protocols to find the most efficient paths between locations.</li>
