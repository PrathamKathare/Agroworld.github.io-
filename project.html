            The city development plan is divided into three phases: Phase 1 focuses on basic infrastructure like education,
            healthcare, and small industries with a budget of ₹25,000 crore. Phase 2 involves large-scale projects such as metro systems and business parks,
            with ₹175,000 crore allocated. Phase 3 targets long-term sustainability, including renewable energy and smart city infrastructure, with an investment of ₹2.2 lakh crore.
            The plan emphasizes growth, sustainability, and technological innovation.

            <img src="chart.jpg" alt="img unavailable" class="project-image">
                <p class="project-features">Zones Identified:
                    <ul class="colourss">
                        <li style="color: yellow;">Yellow Zone: Likely represents the Educational area.</li>
                        <li style="color: orange;">Orange Zone: May indicate the Residential area.</li>
                        <li style="color: purple;">Purple Zone: Could denote Industrial area.</li>
                        <li style="color: green;">Green Zone: Represents Commercial aera.</li>
                        <li style="color: cyan;">Blue Zone: Denotes water bodies (lake, river, or reservoirs).</li>
                        <li style="color: white;">White Zone: Denotes Agricultural land.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Key Features:

                    
                    The agricultural fields are located on the outskirts, ensuring separation from urban and industrial zones.
                    Water bodies are centrally placed or near agricultural zones, which may serve as irrigation sources.
                    A well-defined airport area is marked, possibly close to industrial and business hubs for logistic convenience.
                    Topography Details:
                    Flat Areas: The map mostly suggests flat terrain for urban and agricultural use, indicated by the layout consistency.
                    
                    Water Influence: The blue-colored water body suggests the presence of a lake or reservoir that could influence nearby agriculture and urban water supply.
                    
                    Zoning Integration: The proximity of industrial areas to residential and agricultural zones implies careful zoning to balance economy and livability.</p>
